# Multiversal Feedback Component
A reusable web component for submitting feedback. This web component uses [Lit Element](https://lit.dev) to create a reusable feedback component for use with any framework. 

Currently a proof of concept.  The idea is to allow any app regardless of framework to incorporate the feedback component. Also, allow for customizing language and style.
